# Utilizing Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction and Building an Interactive Web Application

In this project, we employed machine learning techniques to predict a patient's diabetes status based on a questionnaire consisting of several related symptoms. The main goal was to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic. Subsequently, we deployed this trained model into a web-based application using Flask, which was hosted on the Hostinger platform. To enhance user experience and provide insightful data visualizations, we integrated the Plotly Dash platform seamlessly into the Flask app.

## Technology Stack
The technologies utilized in this project were carefully chosen to ensure efficiency and accuracy. The main tools and frameworks employed include:

- Python: The primary programming language used for the machine learning model development and web application creation.
- Jupyter Notebooks: We utilized Jupyter Notebooks for interactive and collaborative development during the machine learning model creation process.
- Scikit-learn (sklearn): This powerful library provided the necessary tools for building and training the machine learning model.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation, preprocessing, and feature engineering, Pandas helped us prepare the dataset for model training.
- Flask: A lightweight and versatile web framework, Flask allowed us to develop the web application to deploy our machine learning model.
- Plotly Dash: Integrated into the Flask app, Plotly Dash enabled us to generate interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
- jQuery: Leveraging asynchronous functions with jQuery, we optimized the user experience and ensured smooth interactions in the web application.
- Bootstrap 5: We adopted Bootstrap 5 to achieve a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design, making the web application accessible across various devices.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout the duration of this project, we gained valuable experience in several key areas:

1. **Machine Learning Model Development**: We honed our skills in constructing and training a machine learning model for classification tasks. This included understanding feature selection, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning using Scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebooks.

2. **Tool Proficiency**: Working with Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Seaborn exposed us to the essential tools widely used in the machine learning community, enhancing our competence in these technologies.

3. **Web Application Development with Flask**: By building a web application using Flask, we learned about web frameworks, routing, and handling user requests. This allowed us to serve our machine learning model predictions to end-users efficiently.

4. **Integration of Plotly Dash**: We explored the seamless integration of Plotly Dash into a Flask application, harnessing its interactive data visualization capabilities. This skill enabled us to create dynamic and insightful visualizations for users.

5. **Asynchronous Functions with jQuery and AJAX**: By incorporating jQuery and AJAX in the diagnosis form, we improved the web application's responsiveness and user experience. Asynchronous operations facilitated real-time interactions without interrupting the user flow.

Overall, this project provided us with a comprehensive understanding of machine learning model development, web application deployment, and the importance of interactive data visualizations for end-users. The combination of these skills sets a solid foundation for our future endeavors in the field of data science and web development.
